This file and this directory are automatically created when you login
by /etc/profile.d/sbt-config.sh.  sbt produces many temporary files
that normally accumulate in /tmp and cause problems with our servers,
so sbt is configured in /etc/sbtopts to use this directory instead.
Please remove the directory periodically so that the disk space is
freed up for others to use.  See also the clulab/clulab wiki page at
https://github.com/clulab/clulab/wiki/Lab-Servers for more information.
You can override this behavior by reassigning the environment variable
$SBT_TMP_DIR.
