TL;DR: Remove this directory periodically to save disk space.

This file and this directory are automatically created when you run
/usr/bin/sbt.  sbt usually stores the dependencies of your projects
in the hidden directory ~/.ivy2, which eventually causes problems
with our servers when disk space runs out.  Unless you have overridden
the value for -ivy in your own .sbtopts file or as an argument
to sbt, these dependency files are now exposed here and should itch
enough that you periodically delete them.  See also the clulab/clulab
wiki page at https://github.com/clulab/clulab/wiki/Lab-Servers for more
information.
